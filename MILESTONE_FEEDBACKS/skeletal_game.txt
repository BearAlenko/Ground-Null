Team 2
Grade: 95
Creative:
+25 Sprite sheet animation.

Issues:
-5 Performance: the game doesnâ€™t run smoothly. It can freeze every now and then.

Feedback:
It seems that there is a significant work imbalance. Apart from fixing bugs, we expect each student at least finish some small features or a medium-size feature at the end of the semester.

In terms of the game, it would be better to have acceleration-based motions. The current motion is generated purely using constant velocity, which looks artificial.
